The first post of any site is always special, so what better way to kick off PaleoHacks.org than with a kick ass salad.  This lemon and balsamic kale creation included sweet strawberry and orange accents to the tart lemon and vinegar base.  The crunch of walnuts added a nice mouth feel to the experience with an avocado and shrimp finish.

If you can believe it I found this great salad at the Morton Arboretum located in Lisle, IL.  After a long morning of walking around with my kids I found myself dreading what the take out cafeteria would offer.  I knew they would have some kind of salad, but I didn't have a lot of hope that it would be anything exciting.

Boy was I wrong.  I couldn't have asked for more in a salad, and really this is something I am sure could be easily replicated at home.  The dressing didn't seem to be anything other than balsamic with a healthy dose of lemon.  The kale looked like it was run through a food processor to give it almost the consistency of tabbouleh.

This is definitely something I will have again.
