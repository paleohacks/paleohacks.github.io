If you like fried chicken this recipe is for you.  Let me tell you about the Smashed Coconut Chicken I made last night.  Fresh out of the pages of my new cookbook from the folks over at nomnompaleo.com this chicken recipe was a quick and savoury delight.

In the cookbook this chicken gets paired with an amazing looking pineapple salsa.  But I had two problems.  First I had to be somewhere in 30 minutes, and second I didn't have a pineapple and the other required ingredients for the salsa.  Luckily the old standby was available (steamed broccoli).

I was really excited to make this recipe because the chicken gets coated in a coconut flour mix and friend in ghee.  Up until last night it felt like forever since I had anything fried.  So the excitement was high.

So the process went like this:
- Cover the chicken breasts in parchment paper and smash with a rolling pin until it was the thickness of a decent flank steak.
- Coat the chicken in the coconut mix, shaking off any big clumps.
- Cooking each side for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown.
- Put cooked chicken on a rack with a tented aluminium cover to keep it warm.

The racks I found really were a huge benefit, I didn't realize how big the chicken breasts would be in their smashed state.  I was using a fairly large frying pan and could just fit one breast in at a time.

The coconut mix couldn't have been simpler:
- 1/2 cup of Coconut Flour
- 1 tbsp. Garlic Powder
- 1 tsp. Salt 
- 1 tsp. Pepper

As you can see my execution could have been better.  I found myself  initially focusing more on the timer than checking to see if it was a crispy golden brown.  This lead to a few pieces being cooked more than I would have liked, but nobody complained so no harm, no fowl (lol).

My wife asked if I beat an egg and used it to coat the chicken before adding the mix. I thought that was a great idea, it would make things stick a little better.  I'll have to try that next time.

Overall I would call this dish an easy win.  The coconut flour gave the chicken (and kitchen) a hint of sweetness that was enjoyed by everyone.  And it made for great left-overs today.
