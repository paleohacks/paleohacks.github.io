If am am being honest, I have always had unhealthy eating habits. I recently switched to a Paleo Lifestyle to help address these concerns.
 
Come with me as I explore everything that Paleo Culture has to offer.

Along the way if I find a Paleo hack that I find noteworth I will share it here, along those same lines, if you have a great Paleo hack to share, please email it to me to be featured on this site.
