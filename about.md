Hey thanks for stopping by PaleoHacks.org.  My name is Stephen Lange and I started PaleoHacks.org to document and explore interesting Paleo diet hacks I have come across either in person or online.  I am especially interested in items that can be easily replicated (e.g. hacks) at home.

Working full time and raising two kids doesn't leave a lot of time for my wife and I in the kitchen, any hacks that make things easier are always welcome.  That is not to say that this site will only be limited to recipes.  Anything Paleo related that I find interesting is fair game.

You will notice that there are no advertisements on this page, this is for one simple reason -- I hate them.  Let's be honest, this site is for my enjoyment, even if it becomes insanely popular the potential ad revenue is not worth the annoyance it will cause me having to look at it.

If you have a kick ass Paleo hack you have run across and want to share, please email it to me at stvlange@gmail.com and I will post it here with a tip of the hat to you for sending it my way.  

Lastly, if you are a vendor that has a great Paleo product that you would like reviewed here just shoot me a message and I will be happy to give your product a fair shake.  The only two rules I have are:
- Anything you send me will not be returned (too much hassle)
- I will give my honest opinion (good or bad) about your product.
